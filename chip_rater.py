# Interview people about their perception of 
# the taste of potato chips. We will ask them
# a set of questions. In the end, we'll give an
# aggregate score. 

# Greet the user (being frienly as possible lol)
print("Please answer the following questions on the chip you just ate. :)")

# Create a list of questions to ask
questions = [
    "How crispy is the chip on a scale on 1 to 5? 5 is very crispy, 1 is mushy"
    "How would you rate the taste from 1 to 5? 5 is best chip ever. 1 is I'd rather not eat it"
    "From 1 to 5, how would you rate the packaging. 1 is someone got paid to put this together?" 
]

# For every question in that list: 
    # Ask the question
    # Get the user's rating
    # Add the rating to some total-rating 


# Do some math on the results
# Present the results
